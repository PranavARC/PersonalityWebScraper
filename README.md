# SmashboardsArticleScraper
 Personal project to display the article titles on a given news page of https://smashboards.com and to select one of them for reading in a web browser.

 An experiment with web scraping technologies in Python.

 ## Branch Functionality ##
master: Lists out every article  
lister: Doesn't list articles  
looper: Allows selection of different page

master also contains an extra file (viewer.py) that lets me see the views on each of my articles
