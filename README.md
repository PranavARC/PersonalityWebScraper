# SmashboardsArticleScraper
 Personal project to display the article titles on a given news page of https://smashboards.com and to select one of them for reading in a web browser (scraper.py).

 An experiment with web scraping technologies in Python.

 ## Branch Descriptions ##
master: Lists out every article  
timer: Corrects for timezones in viewer.py (requires user to install pytz on their machine)

master and timer contain an extra file (viewer.py) that lets me see the views on each of my articles, the dates they were written, my total views, and the days since I wrote my last article.

(outdated)  
lister: Doesn't list articles  
looper: Allows selection of different page without relaunching
